# Project `HYF-duck-duck-go`

> This project is created by two students of **HackYourFuture** [Nadia](https://github.com/ms-np) and [Aleksandra](https://github.com/aleks2407)

_The purpose of this project is to continue developing our skills in HTML and CSS, using GitHub workflow, collaborative creating of the website using branches in terms of safe developing of code and not affecting the main project without review of team-members and their approval._

We recreated a HOME page of [DuckDuckGo](duckduckgo.com)

## Workflow:
- Plan your work in the team: split the tasks, create initial repository and a project board displaying the progress of accomplishment;
- Write development-strategy representing each step of work and who is responsible for it
- Each team-member creates issues accordingly to the assigned tasks
- Each step is created on a separate branch and merged to the master upon approval of the reviewer and assignee of PR
- Each PR is linked to the issue and closes it when PR is approved. The issiue is moved to the column "DONE"
