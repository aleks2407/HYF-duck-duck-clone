# Development Strategy

> `HYF-duck-duck-clone`

A clone of the [DuckDuckGo home page.](duckduckgo.com) Created by two students of HYF: Nadia and Aleksandra. Creating this website we practice working with branches on GitHub, planning the workflow using "Issues" tool and the "Project board". Each step is created on a well-named branch and merged to the master branch upon approval of the other team-member.
